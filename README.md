## 🧠 Overview

This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict **aqueous solubility (logS)** of drug-like molecules using the **Delaney (ESOL)** dataset.  
The study demonstrates how **molecular descriptors** can be used to estimate a key pharmacokinetic property — solubility — which plays a critical role in **drug absorption, distribution, and bioavailability**.

The notebook — `Molecular_Properties_for_Drug_Discovery.ipynb` — walks through the full data science workflow:
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization  
3. Feature selection and correlation analysis  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Insights and interpretation of results
